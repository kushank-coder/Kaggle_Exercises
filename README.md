# Kaggle_Exercises
Additional Practises on Kaggle to apply the new concepts
Image Classification Code.ipynb : This notebook is basically practising tensorflow concepts and neural networks on images. The dataset leveraged for this code was CIFAR-10 dataset for building a multi class classifier that could given an image , tell us whether it belongs to airplane , automobile , bird , cat , deer , dog , frog , horse , ship OR truck.
The images are first downloaded in the local computer from Kaggle. This code also gives insights on how validation directory etc can be leveraged.
* Additionally it also levergaes os library, so it gives insights on those libraries as well.
* ImageDataGenerator : Usability of Image data generator in tensorflow
